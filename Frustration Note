I'd like to point out that these training platforms piss me off like crazy.
They do their best to fill your mind with knowledge, except they feed you pages
of useless stuff until, when the useful content finally comes, they place it behind a paywall.

I understand they need to monetize, but at least take away the fake promise of being free.
The free content on these platforms is absolutely 0% useful and just filler that you can easily find anywhere.

My suggestion to fix this problem is to let free users access a single sub-chapter per day for free.
Those with fewer financial resources would still be able to learn.

This solution would benefit both users and the company.

Website visits would increase.
Profits would (most likely) increase.
Users would actually be able to do something (lol).

Anyway, if you've read this far, you probably feel the same way. Companies are gatekeeping knowledge like crazy, which is actually preventing them from making more money (lol).
This is also the main reason this project of mine stopped, I'll continue it when I can.
