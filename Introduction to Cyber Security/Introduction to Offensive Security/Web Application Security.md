The idea of a web application is that it is a program running on a remote server.

Consider an online shopping application. The web application will read the data about the products and their details from a database server.
A database is used to store information in an organized way.
Examples include information about products, customers, and invoices.
A database server is responsible for many functions, including reading, searching, and writing to the database.
The online shopping web application might need more than one database to access, for example:

    Products database: This database contains details about the products, such as name, images, specifications, and price.
    Customers database: It contains all details related to customers, such as name, address, email, and phone number.
    Sales database: We expect to see what each customer has purchased and how they paid in this database.

From the user’s perspective, they will only access an elegant online shop where all the technical infrastructure is hidden.

Many companies offer bug bounty programs. A bug bounty program allows the company to offer a reward for anyone who discovers a security vulnerability (weakness) in the company’s systems.
