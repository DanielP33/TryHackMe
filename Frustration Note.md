Id just like to point out that these training platforms piss me off like crazy
they do their best in illuding your mind with knowledge except they feed you 
pages of useless stuff untill, when the useful stuff comes they place it behind
a paywall.

I understand they need their monitezation, but at least take away the fake promise
of being free. The free content in these platforms is absolutely 0% useful and just
filler content that you can get find easily anywhere.

My suggestion to this problem is to let the free user be able to do a single free
sub-chapter per day. Those with less possibilities would be able to learn.

This solution would benefit both users and the company. 
Website visits would increase
Profits would (most likely) increase
The user would actually be able to do something (xd)

Anyways if you read this far you probably feel the same way, companies are
gatekeeping knowledge like crazy which is unsmartly keeping them away from 
actually making more money(lol).
